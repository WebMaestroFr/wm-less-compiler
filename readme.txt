LESS compiler for WordPress. Allows you to write and compile LESS, and to edit style variables straight into your WordPress dashboard.

== Description ==

Write LESS, edit your variables and compile your stylesheet from your dashboard.

[Read the documentation](http://webmaestro.fr/less-compiler-wordpress/)

  - Register and enqueue your LESS sheets the same way you would do for your CSS.

    ```
    wp_enqueue_style( 'my-less-handle', 'http://example.com/css/mystyle.less', $deps, $ver, $media );
    ```

  - Configure the plugin with the `less_configuration` filter.

    Configuration of the plugin is optional, but you should at least register your variables if you are using a CSS framework.

  - Set a LESS variable value

    ```
    less_set( $variable, $value );
    ```

  - Get a LESS variable value

    ```
    less_get( $variable );
    ```

You will most likely use these functions in your theme's `functions.php`.

The plugin uses [the Less.php Compiler](http://lessphp.gpeasy.com/).
